# Validation Cases

This repository presents a series of validation cases based on the scientific paper:

**REFERENCE**  
*The reader is referred to the REFERENCE for more details.*

---

## Description

Each validation case differs in terms of the **initial condition** and **injection condition**, as summarized in **Table 1** below:

For each case, the simulation results are compared against the **three-phase fractional flow theory analytical solution** presented in **REFERENCE**.
